#### **Complex Network Link Prediction** is a python library that implements some of the main techniques and algorithms to perform link predictions.


Check out our [home page](docs link)link pages qui for more information.

This library implemented in python allows you to use some of the main algorithms and methods to perform link predictions. It was designed to carry out these tasks in **Complex Networks** and, specifically, in **Social Networks**. Each method has its own specific documentation available on the following page ---- where it is possible to see the required parameters and the output of the method itself. <br>
The methods are distinguished by belonging to categories and subcategories, below is an example image with all the categories.

The speed of computation differs both from the type of method and from the input graph. However, for convention and efficiency we have chosen to use the `csr_matrix` sparse matrix structure from the ***scipy*** library in each algorithm.


## Install
```
pip install cnlp
```

<hr>


## How to use
```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from cnlp.utils import to_adjacency_matrix
from cnlp.probabilistich_methods import stochastic_block_model

G = nx.karate_club_graph()
A = to_adjacency_matrix(G)

res = stochastic_block_model(G, 10)

predicted_edges = []
for u in range(res.shape[0]):
    for v in range(u + 1, res.shape[1]):
        if G.has_edge(u, v):
            continue
        w = res[u, v]
        predicted_edges.append((u, v, w))

# Sort the predicted edges by weight in descending order
predicted_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Print the predicted edges with their weight score
print("Top Predicted edges:")
for edge in predicted_edges[:50]:
    print(f"({edge[0]}, {edge[1]}): {edge[2]}")

nx.draw(G)
plt.show()
```

### Contribute üí•
As there are still many methods to implement and, at the same time, maintaining a library takes up a lot of time, we are always happy to accept new willing and able people to contribute and support our project.

If you want to contribute or you've found a bug, you can open a **Pull Request**.

Check this [tutorial](#https://github.com/Typing-Monkeys/social-network-link-prediction/wiki/monkeflow-Workflow-ü¶ç) if you want to use our preferred *Workflow* ü¶ç for developing.

Otherwise you can open a normal Pull Request using `git` and help us to make this project even better!

### Help ‚ùì
If you encounter any bug or you have some problem with this package you can open an [issue](#https://github.com/Typing-Monkeys/social-network-link-prediction/wiki/monkeflow-Workflow-ü¶ç) to report it, we will resolve that asap.
