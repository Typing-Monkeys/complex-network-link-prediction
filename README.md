#### **Complex Network Link Prediction** is a python library that implements some of the main techniques and algorithms to perform link predictions.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Typing-Monkeys/social-network-link-prediction/develop/imgs/logo.png" alt="logo" width="70%" />

This library, implemented in python, allows you to use some of the main algorithms and methods to perform link predictions. It was designed to carry out these tasks in **Complex Networks** and, specifically, in **Social Networks**. Each method has its own specific documentation available on the [official documentation page](https://typing-monkeys.github.io/social-network-link-prediction/), where it is possible to see the required parameters and the output of the method itself. <br>
The methods are distinguished by belonging to categories and subcategories, below is an example image with all the categories.

The speed of computation differs both from the type of method and from the input graph. However, for convention and efficiency, we have chosen to use the `csr_matrix` sparse matrix structure from the ***scipy*** library in each algorithm.


## Install
```
pip install complex-network-link-prediction
```

<hr>


## How to use
```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from cnlp.similarity_methods.local_similarity import common_neighbors
from cnlp.utils import nodes_to_indexes, get_top_predicted_link

G = nx.karate_club_graph()

name_index_map = list(nodes_to_indexes(G).items())

predicted_adj_matrix_common_neighbors = common_neighbors(G)

new_links = get_top_predicted_link(predicted_adj_matrix_common_neighbors, G.number_of_nodes(), pct_new_link=5, name_index_map=name_index_map, verbose=True)
```

### Contribute üí•
As there are still many methods to implement and, at the same time, maintaining a library takes up a lot of time, we are always happy to accept new willing and able people to contribute and support our project.

If you want to contribute or you've found a bug, you can open a **Pull Request**.

Check this [tutorial](https://github.com/Typing-Monkeys/social-network-link-prediction/wiki/monkeflow-Workflow-ü¶ç) if you want to use our preferred *Workflow* ü¶ç for developing.

Otherwise you can open a normal Pull Request using `git` and help us to make this project even better!

### Help ‚ùì
If you encounter any bug or you have some problem with this package you can open an [issue](https://github.com/Typing-Monkeys/social-network-link-prediction/wiki/monkeflow-Workflow-ü¶ç) to report it, we will resolve that asap.
